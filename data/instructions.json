Depending on the situation, we may try the following methods:\n- retry the call after some time;\n- attempt to de-initialize the driver and re-initialize it again;\n- fix the error condition using an out-of-band mechanism (e.g reset an external peripheral which is not responding).\nExample:\n```\nesp_err_t err; do { err = sdio_slave_send_queue(addr, len, arg, timeout); // keep retrying while the sending queue is full } while (err == ESP_ERR_TIMEOUT); if (err != ESP_OK) { // handle other errors }\n```\n2. Propagate the error to the caller. In some middleware components this means that a function must exit with the same error code, making sure any resource allocations are rolled back.\nExample: How does error propagation differ from recovery strategies in SDIO slave communication?",
    "answer": "Error recovery involves attempting actions like retrying or resetting peripherals, while error propagation means returning the error code to the caller without further attempts at recovery."

However if the application project disables compiler warnings, this issue might go undetected and the IllegalInstruction exception will occur at run time. How does ESP-IDF build system handle missing return statements in C++ code by default?",
